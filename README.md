# Bank-Customer-Churning

A bank is investigating a very high rate of customers leaving the bank.The dataset contain 10,000 records from which we need to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.

For this project, we will perform Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and build Neural Network models to predict if a customer would exit or stay.
